# Summary

This is the repo for the DSB Challenge on Sustainability in partnership with TotalEnergie. This challenge aims at predicting the needs in EV charging station in France, with a specific deployment roadmap for Vosges and Bordeaux region.

# Data

1. Historic data on the repartition of the automobile fleet in France (Ministry of Transport)
2. Demographic data and forecasting (INSEE)
3. Use of EV charging station 

# Methodology

In order to predict the need in EV charging station, we use the Ministry of Transport data and demographic projection in order to forecast the number of EV in France. We take some hypothesis on the effect of future regulation, detailled in Appendeix. We also use historical data of use of EV charging station to link the future number of EV with a required number of charging station. The roadmap is taking into consideration the long deployment scheme for such a station (around 2 yers of investment).
